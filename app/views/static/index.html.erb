        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This webpage is used by stakeholders at Prism Holdings to track bi-weekly sales records, including closed sales, inventory levels, and sales leads.</p>

        <h2>Data Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>I tried to make the data as realistic as possible, but please keep in mind that it is not based on actual sales records. Some inconsistencies may exist, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Location and phone number mismatches</li>
          <li>Unrealistic vehicle pricing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some data is dynamically generated and will change if you run <code>db:reset</code>. Try it out!</p>
        <p><em>Future improvement:</em> Create a function to manage data proportions across tables more consistently.</p>
